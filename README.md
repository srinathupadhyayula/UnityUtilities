These assets have been modified and reorganized make them easier to access regardless of the author
Ex: Instead of accessing AuthorA.Utils.Namespace.ClassA and AuthorB.Utilities.NameSpace.ClassB
the reorganization allows easier access Ex: Utilities.NameSpace.ClassA and Utilities>NameSpace.ClassB

Note: Samples and tests associated with the various packages(uploaded to this repository, modified or otherwise) 
have not been added to the repository. This is because, the various modifications to those packages have either broken the 
default tests/samples of those packages or are no longer useful. To address this, each test and sample will be manually 
tested, modified, and redone to make sure they are doing what they are supposed to, before they are added to the repository. 

Some new samples and tests will also be added where they are deemed required or useful.

UNTIL THEN:PLEASE USE THIS PACKAGE WITH CARE AND AT YOUR OWN RISK
